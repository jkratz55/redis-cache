# Contributing

Contributions to this repository/project are welcome but prior to contributing please fully read this contributing guide. 

## General Guidelines

* Prior to contributing code please first open an issue to discuss the change you wish to make and if applicable what value the change is adding.
* New code should be covered by unit tests.
* Breaking changes should go into a new version.
* Update README.md with any documentation changes if applicable.
* All builds and unit tests should pass

## Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct is simple ... be respectful and don't be an ass. Open source is a thankless job and the last thing I want to deal with in an open source project in drama.
